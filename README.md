## Description of the Roomie - The Game


A Story based Android Game which is designed to simulate the life of a common Student at the Flat with other Students. 

Throughout the flow of Roomie, the player is going to face with different situations which will lead him different choices. 
These situations are mainly focused on common problems and some extreme cases about a Student's Flat Life resulting with academic and social life dilemmas. The ways that players handle the problems will change the course of events of the game. Eventually, these paths will determine who you are going to be after your graduation which is the end of the game.
