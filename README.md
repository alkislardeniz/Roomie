# Roomie
## CS-319 Object Oriented Programming Term Project 


- Current Stage: Revised Design Report is uploaded to the GitHub. As developers of the Roomie, iteration is continue. Branches are created as 3 individual(eliz(Eliz Tekcan)-alkışlar(Deniz Alkışlar)-Yoda(Serhat Aras)) and 1 shared for the works of Deniz Alkışlar and Serhat Aras. Yet Master is ready to clone and pull and up to date. Reports' links and roadmap for the following weeks added to GitHub README.md.

## Description of the Roomie - The Game


A Story based Android Game which is designed to simulate the life of a common Student at the Flat with other Students. 

Throughout the flow of Roomie, the player is going to face with different situations which will lead him different choices. 
These situations are mainly focused on common problems and some extreme cases about a Student's Flat Life resulting with academic and social life dilemmas. The ways that players handle the problems will change the course of events of the game. Eventually, these paths will determine who you are going to be after your graduation which is the end of the game. 


## Technical Details of the Project


- Android API 23 (Marshmallow) is going to be used in the project developement.
